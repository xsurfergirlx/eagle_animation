<h1>Eagle Animation</h1>
<h2>Code in Place 2024 final project submission</h2>
<p>A simple animation where the user controls the animation using buttons.
Play button starts the animation loop.
Pause button pauses the animation.
Rewind button moves the animation back one frame when button is clicked.
Forward button moves animation forward one frame when button is clicked.
Stop button stops the animation and exits the animation.
Info button opens help window.</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>The inspiration for this project came from a similar project I completed in Flash back in 2009 for my Diploma in Multimedia.</p>
<p>Back then I hand drew each frame of the animation using my Wacom tablet. This time around I didn't feel I had enough time to realistically achieve that, so I cheated and used images from Adobe Stock.
Perhaps I will add hand drawn frames in the future, along with a scrolling background :-)</p>
